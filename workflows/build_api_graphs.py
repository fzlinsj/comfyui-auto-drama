Tiny glowing orange particles drift in from the edges and converge into the center, forming a single line of bold white text: "MINIMAX H3". A warm orange rim light sweeps across the letterforms as the text locks into place, then a smaller letterspaced grey line appears below it: "OPEN SOURCE". The camera pushes in with small amplitude at slow speed toward the text. A confident male narrator says in an off-screen voiceover: <d>[Chinese] MiniMax H3 开源了。文字、图片、视频、声音，一次全理解，直接生成带原生立体声的视频。</d> [Shot 2] At 00:06.500, the shot cuts to an extreme close-up of the glowing letter edges as the scene slowly fades to black.

overall_soundscape: Deep electronic drone fading in with a soft rising shimmer, then silence as the screen fades to black.

The camera holds a static shot. He sits facing the camera with a calm, slightly tired expression, then his eyes widen with sudden realization and he breaks into an exaggerated grin. He leans toward the camera, points at the lens, and speaks with an excited, slightly theatrical voice: <d>[Chinese] 以前，AI 视频是土豪的玩具。一条五秒，几十块。</d> He claps his hands together in a triumphant pose, gives a smug nod, and adds with a proud smirk: <d>[Chinese] 直到 MiniMax 把 H3 开源了。</d> He settles back with a satisfied grin while the camera pushes in with small amplitude at slow speed. Nothing flies across the frame at any point during the shot; no birds, insects, papers, particles, or objects pass in front of the camera, and the background remains completely static.

overall_soundscape: Quiet indoor room tone with a faint fan hum and soft fabric rustle as he moves.

PROMPT_T2_SCIFI = """integrated_multimodal_description: [Shot 1] Cinematic, medium wide shot, the camera pushes in slowly. In the cavernous, dimly lit bridge of a starship, sleek metallic consoles with glowing amber displays flank a massive curved observation window. A female captain in her late 40s with short silver-streaked black hair stands in the center midground with her back to the camera, silhouetted against cool starlight. Outside the window, a massive armada of jagged dark-grey dreadnoughts hovers in tight formation against a deep purple nebula. The fleet's rear thrusters begin to glow with escalating bright blue light. A calm male narrator says in an off-screen voiceover: <d>[Chinese] 这段科幻镜头，画面和声音是模型一次生成的——H3 能同时理解文字、图像、视频和音频，端到端输出带原生立体声的视频。</d> [Shot 2] At 00:04.500, the camera cuts to a close-up of the captain's face and shakes strongly. The blue-white light reflects in her dark eyes as a blinding flash floods the window. The bridge jolts violently and she staggers slightly forward, bracing herself. As the light fades, she slowly closes her eyes in the newly emptied space.

overall_soundscape: A low resonant hum of the ship's life support serves as the baseline, soon drowned by an escalating high-pitched electronic whine as the fleet charges hyperdrives. A massive bass-heavy boom and sharp crackle erupts at the flash, followed by metallic creaking and deep thuds, then cuts abruptly back to a hollow echoing room tone.

non_diegetic_music: Cinematic space-opera orchestral score, slow tempo, a solitary mournful French horn melody over deep sustained string dissonances that build rapidly to a massive peak, then snap into silence right after the jump."""

A small round robot with big expressive eyes rolls along a bright pastel hallway, its antenna bobbing with each movement. The camera tracks beside it at a medium distance. The robot stops at a doorway, tilts its head, and a paper plane flies past. The robot leaps with exaggerated squash-and-stretch, catches the plane mid-air, and lands with a soft bounce, beaming with pride. A warm male narrator says in an off-screen voiceover: <d>[Chinese] 3D 动画，角色一致、表演有弹性——H3 的指令遵循和运动控制都很稳。</d> [Shot 2] At 00:06.000, the shot cuts to a close-up of the robot's face as it holds the paper plane up, eyes sparkling, then gives one confident nod.

overall_soundscape: Soft mechanical whirrs, gentle rubbery footsteps, a light whoosh of the paper plane, and a soft landing thud.

non_diegetic_music: Playful orchestral pizzicato at a cheerful tempo with light percussion, ending on a short resolved chord."""

His hands keep a consistent natural skin tone and shape in every frame; there is no color shift, discoloration, or distortion on his hands or fingers at any point.
